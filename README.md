# Synthetic short-TE 1H MRS datasets and basis sets with various linewidth
Welcome to the repository containing synthetic brain-like 1H MR (Magnetic Resonance) data and associated basis sets. This collection is designed to provide researchers and enthusiasts with a diverse range of synthetic datasets, featuring various linewidths and various Voigt lineshapes.

1. Synthetic Brain-like 1H MR Data:

The synthetic MR data in this repository mimic brain-like signals typically encountered in in vivo 1H MR experiments acquired by short-TE sequences at 7T. These datasets have been carefully generated to simulate realistic scenarios and encompass a wide spectrum of linewidths (from 7 Hz to 20 Hz) and Voigt lineshapes. They serve as valuable tools for testing and validating analytical methods, simulation algorithms, and spectral fitting approaches.

2. Basis Sets with Different Linewidths and Lorentzian Shape:

In addition to the synthetic data, we are also providing basis sets with different linewidths, specifically ranging from 1 Hz to 25 Hz. These basis sets are characterized by a Lorentzian lineshape, a fundamental distribution commonly observed in NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy and MR studies. Researchers can utilize these basis sets as references or building blocks for spectral analysis and processing tasks.

Usage:

Researchers and practitioners in the field of MR spectroscopy and related disciplines can benefit from this repository in the following ways:

Method Validation: Use the synthetic MR data to test the accuracy and effectiveness of your spectral analysis methods, quantification algorithms, and signal processing techniques.

Algorithm Development: Develop and optimize new algorithms for linewidth estimation, peak fitting, and spectral deconvolution using the provided basis sets.

Education and Research: Utilize the datasets for educational purposes, such as demonstrations, tutorials, or research projects in the field of MR spectroscopy.

Note:

The files shared in this repository are not restricted to a specific submission or publication. They are freely available for the scientific community to use and modify as needed. We encourage collaboration and contributions to enhance the quality and diversity of the datasets. Please refer to the README files in the folder for detailed descriptions of the datasets and basis sets.

Disclaimer:

While these synthetic datasets aim to simulate MR signals acquired by short-TE sequence at ultra-high field, they are not actual human brain data. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results and applying them to real-world scenarios.

We hope that this repository proves to be a valuable resource for advancing the field of MR spectroscopy and its applications in various domains. Should you have any questions, feedback, or contributions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
