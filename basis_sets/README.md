Basis Sets with various linewidths and Lorentzian shape used in LCModel

This repository contains basis sets with experimentally measured macromolecule (BW=6kHz, pppm=295.1MHz, acquired by short-TE sequence) and 20 metabolites commonly found in human brain NMR spectroscopy. The metabolites included in these basis sets are:

Ascorbate (Asc)
Alanine (Ala)
Aspartate (Asp)
Creatine (Cr)
Phosphocreatine (PCr)
Glucose (Glc)
Glutamine (Gln)
Glutamate (Glu)
Glutathione (GSH)
Glycerolphosphorylcholine (GPC)
Phosphorylcholine (PCho)
Myo-inositol (Ins)
Lactate (Lac)
N-acetylaspartate (NAA)
N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG)
Phosphorylethanolamine (PE)
Scyllo-inositol (Scyllo)
Taurine (Tau)
Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
Glycine (Gly)

The linewidth of the metabolite basis spectra is indicated in the title of each file.
